#AmEquest
===========
![alt tag](https://danamartensmfadt.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/imag9815.jpg)
AmEquest is an interactive game in the style of a scavenger hunt.

- Players must find four "amethysts" (each with its own RFID tag) and scan them to solve the game and unlock the treasure chest with the reward.
- A website provides a clue as to the location of the first item, and each time an item is found and logged in, a new clue will appear.
- If more than one player finds an item, they must work together to decide how to split the final prize!

This project was build with an Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 3, RFID sensor & RFID tags, electromagnetic lock, piezo, and node.js for the server. It was implemented using the websocket protocol to send data between the website and the technoloogy.

#Material List
- Arduino Uno
- RFID Reader
- RFID Stickers
- Electromagnetic Lock
- Piezo/Speaker
- Button
- Raspberry Pi
- Treasure chest (from Secret Treasure Chest project last Fall)
- Craft supplies and paint to make it pretty (especially cool gold pens)
- My all-purpose project plinth from CitizenScore to hide wires and provide local power

#Background
AmEquest explores how IOT could change the way we perceive and interact with public spaces and objects - and by extension each other - in the future.

I want to understand how we might use technology like RFID and NFC to create more creative relationships with public spaces by allowing anyone to interact with objects and interfaces, whether or not they have a smartphone.

I believe that the Internet of Things has the potential to create unique mixed digital and physical interfaces that bring people together through technology instead of encouraging us to live in our own personal digital worlds (reflected in a 3x5 piece of glass).

You can read more about the project on my [blog](https://danamartensmfadt.wordpress.com/2016/11/01/amequest-the-adventure-begins/).

This project was created for the Internet of Things course for my Master of Fine Art's in Design + Technology at Parsons School of Design in October 2016.
