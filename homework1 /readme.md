Email Send:
For our homework first week, we were tasked to modify our in-class email send script to take user input and have it run calculations within our program and include in the body of the email.

I created a Cat Story Generator that takes user input for:
- Email You Want to Send To
- Friend's Name
- Number Between 1 and 5
- Corresponding follow-up question based on number you select

Cat Story Generator then takes the inputted info and creates a short story based on your responses and attaches a moving (PNG?) of the corresponding image to go with the story. I didn't know PNGs could be animated, but apparently they can!

If the user inputs a number not between 1 and 5 or anything else, a random Cat story is generated for them.
