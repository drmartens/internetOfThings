Email Send:
For our homework first week, we were tasked to modify our in-class email send script to take user input and have it run calculations within our program and include in the body of the email.

My addition was to allow users to pick who it will be sent to, the subject, and then answer some questions which modify the content of the body email.

I also allow them to pick a number 1-5 which will insert a corresponding image as an attachment to the email.
